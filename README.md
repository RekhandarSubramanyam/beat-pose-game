# How to use
* Visit the live demo
* Allow access to the webcam
* Place yourself about 1-2m away from your computer in a place that has enough light.
* Move your hands to see if the recognition works
* Start playing and hit beats!

# Rules
None! It's not a real game, more of an experiment ðŸ™‚.

The only "restriction" is that the left hand can only destroy the red beats and the right hand, the blue beats.
